# butterfly_viewer
Desktop multi-image viewer with sliding overlays and synchronized pan and zoom. Built to rapidly compare local image files from painting analyses including hi-res and raking-light photos, X-rays, and element maps from XRF and RIS. Installs as a Windows executable and runs directly on Python. Very open source.
